# Introduction to single-cell RNA-seq

| Audience | Computational skills required| Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists | [Introduction to R](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/) | 3-session online workshop (~7.5 hours of trainer-led time)|

### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a hands-on **Introduction to single-cell RNA-seq** workshop. This workshop will instruct participants on how to design a single-cell RNA-seq experiment, and how to efficiently manage and analyze the data starting from count matrices. This will be a hands-on workshop in which we will focus on using the Seurat package using R/RStudio. Working knowledge of R is required or completion of the [Introduction to R workshop](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-flipped/). 

**Note for Trainers:** Please note that the schedule linked below assumes that learners will spend between 3-4 hours on reading through, and completing exercises from selected lessons between classes. The online component of the workshop focuses on more exercises and discussion/Q & A.

> These materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.

### Learning Objectives

- Describe best practices for designing a single-cell RNA-seq experiment
- Describe steps in a single-cell RNA-seq analysis workflow
- Use Seurat and associated tools to perform analysis of single-cell expression data, including data filtering, QC, integration, clustering, and marker identification
- Understand practical considerations for performing scRNA-seq, rather than in-depth exploration of algorithm theory

### Installation Requirements

#### Applications
Download the most recent versions of R and RStudio for your laptop:

 - [R](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/) **(version 4.0.0 or above)**
 - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

#### Packages for R

::: callout-note
# Notes

**Note 1: Install the packages in the order listed below.**

**Note 2:  All the package names listed below are case sensitive!**

**Note 3**: If you have a Mac with an M1 chip, download and install this tool before intalling your packages: https://mac.r-project.org/tools/gfortran-12.2-universal.pkg

**Note 4**: At any point (especially if you’ve used R/Bioconductor in the past), in the console **R may ask you if you want to update any old packages by asking Update all/some/none? [a/s/n]:**. If you see this, **type "a" at the prompt and hit Enter** to update any old packages. _Updating packages can sometimes take quite a bit of time to run, so please account for that before you start with these installations._  

**Note 5:** If you see a message in your console along the lines of “binary version available but the source version is later”, followed by a question, **“Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? y/n”, type n for no, and hit enter**.

:::

**(1)** Install the 4 packages listed below from **Bioconductor** using the the `BiocManager::install()` function.

1. `AnnotationHub`
1. `ensembldb`
1. `multtest`
1. `glmGamPoi`

**Please install them one-by-one as follows:**

```{r}
BiocManager::install("AnnotationHub")
BiocManager::install("ensembldb")
& so on ...
```

**(2)** Install the 8 packages listed below from **CRAN** using the `install.packages()` function. 

1. `tidyverse`
2. `Matrix`
3. `RCurl`
4. `scales`
5. `cowplot`
6. `BiocManager`
7. `Seurat`
8. `metap`
9. `reshape2`
10. `plyr`

**Please install them one-by-one as follows:**

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("Matrix")
install.packages("RCurl")
& so on ...
```

**(3)** Finally, please check that all the packages were installed successfully by **loading them one at a time** using the `library()` function.  

```{r}
library(Seurat)
library(tidyverse)
library(Matrix)
library(RCurl)
library(scales)
library(cowplot)
library(metap)
library(reshape2)
library(plyr)
library(AnnotationHub)
library(ensembldb)
library(multtest)
library(glmGamPoi)
```

**(4)** Once all packages have been loaded, run sessionInfo().  

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
