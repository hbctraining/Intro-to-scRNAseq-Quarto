This workshop will instruct participants on how to design a single-cell RNA-seq experiment, and how to efficiently manage and analyze the data starting from count matrices. This will be a hands-on workshop in which we will focus on using the Seurat package using R/RStudio. Working knowledge of R is required or completion of the Introduction to R workshop.\nNote for Trainers: Please note that the schedule linked below assumes that learners will spend between 3-4 hours on reading through, and completing exercises from selected lessons between classes. The online component of the workshop focuses on more exercises and discussion/Q & A.\n\nThese materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nDescribe best practices for designing a single-cell RNA-seq experiment\nDescribe steps in a single-cell RNA-seq analysis workflow\nUse Seurat and associated tools to perform analysis of single-cell expression data, including data filtering, QC, integration, clustering, and marker identification\nUnderstand practical considerations for performing scRNA-seq, rather than in-depth exploration of algorithm theory\n\n\n\nLessons\n\nWorkshop schedule (trainer-led learning)\nSelf-learning\n\n\n\nInstallation Requirements\n\nApplications\nDownload the most recent versions of R and RStudio for your laptop:\n\nR (version 4.0.0 or above)\nRStudio\n\n\n\nPackages for R\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\nNote 1: Install the packages in the order listed below.\nNote 2:  All the package names listed below are case sensitive!\nNote 3: If you have a Mac with an M1 chip, download and install this tool before intalling your packages: https://mac.r-project.org/tools/gfortran-12.2-universal.pkg\nNote 4: At any point (especially if you’ve used R/Bioconductor in the past), in the console R may ask you if you want to update any old packages by asking Update all/some/none? [a/s/n]:. If you see this, type “a” at the prompt and hit Enter to update any old packages. Updating packages can sometimes take quite a bit of time to run, so please account for that before you start with these installations.\nNote 5: If you see a message in your console along the lines of “binary version available but the source version is later”, followed by a question, “Do you want to install from sources the package which needs compilation? y/n”, type n for no, and hit enter.\n\n\n(1) Install the 4 packages listed below from Bioconductor using the the BiocManager::install() function.\n\nAnnotationHub\nensembldb\nmulttest\nglmGamPoi\n\nPlease install them one-by-one as follows:\n\nBiocManager::install(\"AnnotationHub\")\nBiocManager::install(\"ensembldb\")\n& so on ...\n\n(2) Install the 8 packages listed below from CRAN using the install.packages() function.\n\ntidyverse\nMatrix\nRCurl\nscales\ncowplot\nBiocManager\nSeurat\nmetap\nreshape2\nplyr\n\nPlease install them one-by-one as follows:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"Matrix\")\ninstall.packages(\"RCurl\")\n& so on ...\n\n(3) Finally, please check that all the packages were installed successfully by loading them one at a time using the library() function.\n\nlibrary(Seurat)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(Matrix)\nlibrary(RCurl)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(metap)\nlibrary(reshape2)\nlibrary(plyr)\nlibrary(AnnotationHub)\nlibrary(ensembldb)\nlibrary(multtest)\nlibrary(glmGamPoi)\n\n(4) Once all packages have been loaded, run sessionInfo().\n\nsessionInfo()\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\nTo cite material from this course in your publications, please use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation\n\n\n\nMary Piper, Meeta Mistry, Jihe Liu, William Gammerdinger, & Radhika Khetani.
